# ⚡ Interactive Login - 2-Minute Quick Start

## What You Need to Know

Your Trello MCP now **pops for login**. No more manual API key entry!

---

## Step 1: Get Your Credentials

1. Go to: **https://trello.com/app-key**
2. Copy the **API Key** shown at the top
3. Click the **"Token"** link 
4. Copy the **Token** displayed

Keep these ready (you'll paste them when prompted).

---

## Step 2: Make Your First Request

Send any tool request **WITHOUT** credentials:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "search_cards",
    "arguments": {
      "query": "Cisco IronPort"
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** No `api_key` or `token` needed!

---

## Step 3: Browser Opens Automatically

Your browser will automatically open to:
```
https://trello.com/app-key
```

---

## Step 4: Enter Credentials in Terminal

You'll see a prompt like this:

```
🔐 TRELLO LOGIN REQUIRED
============================================================

📋 Enter your Trello API Key: [paste your API key]
🔑 Enter your Trello Token: [paste your token]

✅ Credentials cached for 8 hours
```

---

## Step 5: Done! ✅

Your credentials are now cached. All future requests work instantly:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "list_boards",
    "arguments": {}
  }
}
```

No prompts. No credentials needed. Just instant results.

---

## How Long Does It Last?

**8 hours** - Then you'll be prompted to login again.

---

## Can I Still Use Direct Credentials?

Yes! Just include them in your request:

```json
{
  "params": {
    "name": "search_cards",
    "arguments": {
      "api_key": "your-key",
      "token": "your-token",
      "query": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

This will override the cache.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Browser didn't open?**
- Visit https://trello.com/app-key manually
- Paste your credentials when prompted

**Invalid credentials?**
- Double-check at https://trello.com/app-key
- Make sure token isn't expired
- Try again - you'll be prompted once more

**8 hours expired?**
- Just make another request
- You'll be prompted to login again

   ```

2. **Every Time After (8 hours):**
   ```
   Instant result (cached) ✅
   ```

### Result:
```

       Cisco IronPort Configuration
       ...
```
